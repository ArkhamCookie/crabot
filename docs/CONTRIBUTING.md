## Coding

### Setup Your Golang Environment

1. Confirm you have Go 1.20 [installed](https://go.dev/doc/install)

  ```shell
  go version
  ```

2. Clone this repo

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/ArkhamCookie/crabot
  cd crabot
  ```

3. Install dependencies

  ```shell
  go install
  ```

### New to Golang

If you are new to Go, I **highly** recommend going though [Go's documentation](https://go.dev/doc/).
The best place to start is [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/),
which walks you though the basics of Go.
You can find some helpful tutorials in the [tutorial section](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/) of the docs.

If you are an experienced programmer but new to Go, you can check out [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com) and [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go).

## Financially

Last, *but certainly not least,* you can support the project financially by donating to me, [@ArkhamCookie](https://github.com/ArkhamCookie).

### Direct Donation

You can really help me by sending a donation my way.
I love open source and creating projects to share with the world,
and I hope to make it my full time job eventually.<https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/tree/v0.29.0>

Even a "small" amount, like one dollar, goes a long way;
both to feed my cookie addiction and help motivate me.
There's nothing quite like knowing someone enjoys your work.

You can find me on:

- [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/ArkhamCookie)
- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/ArkhamCookie)
- [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/arkhamcookie)

The **best way** is through [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/ArkhamCookie) because they take a 0% fee of all donations, memberships, commissions, etc.
No matter how you choice to support me, I greatly appreciate it.

### Hire Me

I currently do freelance work.
If you are in need of a developer,
contact me at [hire-me@mail.theuntitledproject.dev](mailto:hire-me@mail.theuntitledproject.dev).

I am always looking for new people to work with and new problems to solve.

#### Website

Speaking of freelance work, one of the things I commonly do is design websites..
If you are a fan of my work and want something in return,
hiring me to design your website is a great way to support me.

I can set up hosting on the hosting provider of your choice
or set you up on a site, like GitHub, for free hosting.
