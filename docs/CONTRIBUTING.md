### Setup Your Golang Environment

1. Confirm you have Go 1.20 [installed](https://go.dev/doc/install)

  ```shell
  go version
  ```

2. Clone this repo

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/ArkhamCookie/crabot
  cd crabot
  ```

3. Install dependencies

  ```shell
  go install
  ```

### New to Golang

If you are new to Go, I **highly** recommend going though [Go's documentation](https://go.dev/doc/).
The best place to start is [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/),
which walks you though the basics of Go.
You can find some helpful tutorials in the [tutorial section](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/) of the docs.

If you are an experienced programmer but new to Go, you can check out [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com) and [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go).
